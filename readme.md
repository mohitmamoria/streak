# Github Streak

I had been making Github Streak for last 670+ days. But because my startup is starting to grow and I had been lately writing less code everyday (and whatever I'm writing, it is more sort of private and copyrighted code), I decided to stop continuing the streak.

But due to a bug in Github, if I stop the sreak now, after a day, it will show the longest streak to be just 365 days (maximum in an year). TO avoid that Github bug, I will be committing dummy commits in this repo now onwards.
